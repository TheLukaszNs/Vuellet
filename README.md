# *Vue*llet ðŸ’°

Simple application to manage your wallet, made with **Vue**!

## About Vuellet

The original name for this app was meant to be _MyWallet_, but since I decided to create it with **Vue**, the better name that came into my head was **Vuellet** _(Vue + Wallet)_

This app is my side project created to learn Vue and Vuetify, but I'll try to do my best to create something amazing!
